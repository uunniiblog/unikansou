The first in the list of the Dengeki collabs in the ebook compilation, originally released on 10 April of 2009. As you can guess by the name it revolves around Spring with all of the stories taking place around April, some of them have more spring related themes with sakura trees, a few others have basically no relation to it other than a background mention. Curiously all of the stories also mention the word ぷよぷよ, I guess it was given as some sort of guideline, but most of the time is just a casual unimportant description. This one has the higher number of compilations with a lot of them being really short.

My favorites here are **４月、それは──永遠のかなたの国　檸檬の終末** from **古橋秀之**, **４月、それは──多感な季節　わたしが恋したＮＧＩＮＮＥ** from **壁井ユカコ** and **４月、それは──眠気漂う季節　　俺とサランラップと春眠暁を覚えずな彼女** from **水瀬葉月**.

### 1- 時雨沢恵一 (Sigsawa Keiichi) - ４月、それは──旅の始まり　花
At the start of Spring one day the protagonist wakes up in his hotel room to a complete silent world, feeling a bit weirded out he decides to go outside and discover that every other human person is dead with violet flowers blooming from their bodies. Confused with what to do he steals a car and starts travelling to the south in search of a warmer climate.
This one has a good hook which I imagine is why it was placed first in order, those who like the survival aspect should enjoy it. Personally I think the story itself isn't really convincing although the mystery with what's going with the flowers makes it somewhat interesting. I feel there's some sort of message about wanting to live alone but didn't really come very clear to me, the ending is kind of funny over the top though.


### 2- 古橋秀之 (Furuhashi Hideyuk) - ４月、それは──永遠のかなたの国　檸檬の終末
Very short story about how Sakura trees hold thousands of corpses, or that's what the protagonist thinks when he remembers the events a couple of weeks ago at the verge of the graduation ceremony when his senpai told him stories about how there's corpses buried under the sakura trees, It isn't a horror story but more of a symbolism that sakura's contain the stories of thousands of people's seishun. Both of them say their goodbyes as their life is going in opposites directions at least for the time being under that Sakura tree in the school mountain. Nails the atmosphere of those 伝説 sakura romance stories, very cute and killer writing overall need to read something from the author that's actually longer than a short story

### 3- 鈴木鈴 (Suzuki Suzu) - ４月、それは──わたしの嫌いな月　地上の翼　人の翼
Story about a Karasu Tengu(カラス天狗), here it is used as a bird that can transform into a complete human. She lives in an area around a sakura village where at the start of every spring a man comes with the aspiration of seeing the beautiful sakura trees that surround the place on air while flying on hand-crafted airplanes. At first our crow looked at him making a bit of fun but through his drive and their relationship through the years she starts falling hin love with him until one year the expected goodbye has to come since he's finally moving to the city for college.
A bit longer for what it is at least compared to others, but has a clear message about how the drive towards the goals is what it makes it worth, instead of being for granted, fits well with the crow pov but other than that a bit too plain.

### 4- 入間人間 (Hiruma Hitoma) - ４月、それは──寿命。　僕の小規模な奇跡
It's about an university student diagnosed with terminal illness with only a few months left to live. It mainly takes place in one day where he decides to visit his senpai from school to confess to her, with all kind of crazy shit happening throughout the entire day. As you'd expect it has a very pessimistic narration from his pov, but it manages to balance it well with the funny stuff going on, really solid story in general, also one of the longer ones about 15k characters, one of the few that doesn't have much to do with spring barring a couple of references

### 5- 壁井ユカコ (Kabei Yukako) - ４月、それは──多感な季節　わたしが恋したＮＧＩＮＮＥ
Another one on the longish side. Takes place in an inaka village with weird traditions, on the night of a festival there is a battle royale tournament where fighters mount some kind of salvage animal and fight until only one of the animals stands left. A teenagler girl named Sakura accompanies her friend since she is in love with one of the combatants, so Sakura goes with her to see the battle. During the battle, in contrast to her friend, she starts feeling like she's in love with the animal that the figher was mounting that won.

So far seemed like the typical fantasy setting didn't had much interest but it becomes way more interesting from here on where she sneaks at night to visit this animal and then discovers the truth of the world they are living in. This is the kind of cool SF setting twist that I love to see and also fits well with the short story format, one of the most interesting if you like some good SF transhumanism. This one also didn't have much spring related stuff, I don't think it's even in April since it mentions second full moon of the year, but the protagonist name is Sakura so there's that.

### 6- 佐藤ケイ (Satou Kei) - ４月、それは──桜舞い散る季節　とある馬と桜の物語
Written in third person about a racing horse and a sakura tree having a long conversation, the horse happens to be in its last legs and decides to take a visit to that sakura tree that he loves so much to ask of him one last request, It's the tearjerker kind of story humanizing both the horse and the tree. I like Satou Kei in general but the stuff I've read from him I can't say it is his strong point this type of story trying too hard for the tearjeker, I prefer him more on the comedy or mix of genres.

### 7- 来楽零 (Rairaku Rei) - ４月、それは──変化の季節　マトリョーシカ
The protagonist here is interested in a girl in his school that suffered an abrupt change in her personality with the new school year. When approached she says she has multiple personality disorder, he's not really convinced so he starts investigating into her past... It's a nice romance with interesting background mystery to it, you can tell the writer is good at writing short fast paced stories, starts a bit slow but once it gets going it keeps the tension nicely. It isn't a really groundbreaking plot, I was expecting a supernatural nakige plot but if anything is way simpler than I imagined and it works in its favor since it's very solid in general. My only gripe is that it ends too abruptly but you could also say that it ends when all has been said.

### 8. 渡瀬草一郎 (Watase Soichiro) - ４月、それは──地球侵略の季節　春のうららの地球侵略
Very Short SF? story about a girl that finds two sea anemones that are actually aliens in her bed when comes back from school, they somehow plan to conquer the world through culture. It isn't serious at all and feels more like some manzai between the two aliens but I didn't found particulary funny or anything it wasn't really my thing so go next.

### 9. 紅玉いづき (Kogyoku Izuki) - ４月、それは──いつか来る春　サエズリ図書館のサトミさん。
Another one very short about an encounter in a library where the old lady recepcionist comforts a client trying to quit writing theater, it's kinda interesting but also kinda hard to understand and way too short.

### 10. 藤原祐 (Fujiwara Yu) - ４月、それは──噓の季節　４人の親友
Kinda like your school social ranking story but with a twist. Follows the train of thought of a group of girl friends that absolutely hate each other and goes to depict how much they wish they'd die in the worst way possible, while also pretending to be nice to each other on the outside. Also very short and random but I guess it's nice if you like some crazy out of the top hatred descriptions.

### 11- 中村恵里加 (Nakamura Erika) - ４月、それは──死にたくなる季節　電話の向こうの虚偽と真実
Our protagonist here is depressed because he can't find a proper full time job after graduating college until one day he receives a call from his imouto telling him to call their grandma that she's trying to get scammed by some scam caller asking for money because her grandson aka the protagonist got into problems. He hasn't talked to her in years and even though she has become way too senile to have proper conversations he somehow finds comfort in this rough times of job hunting talking to her. A nice heartwarming family story, mixes very well the funny and emotional parts.

### 12- 水瀬葉月 (Minase Hazuki) - ４月、それは──眠気漂う季節　　俺とサランラップと春眠暁を覚えずな彼女
The last story of this book, there's a girl in the protagonist's class that has a condition that makes her falls asleep all the time, he gets so irritated and hates her so much that has even made him have some troubles sleeping himself. One day a rumor starts about a misterious attack of a girl masked attacking every man in his class and kissing them with a plastic wrap, it's obviously the sleepy girl and the protagonist finds out when it reaches his turn. Through the power of deduction(panties) he reveals her identity and discovers the secret behind her sleepiness and this kissing attacks... Cute romance story with a funny background also liked this one a lot, it has that perfect spring romcom atmosphere.
