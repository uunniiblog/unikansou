every game has a twist, "realistic" soap opera

Follows Tomoya in his love triangle with his two osananajimi's Yue and Ayaka, or that was what it was supposed be in your typical galge, but here there's a twist, the main heroine Ayaka is dead by the time the game starts. It isn't really straight up said what happened until the routes, but it's hinted a lot through the protagonist's narration and weird flashbacks, even having no idea what MemOff was about before starting I pretty much guessed it after a few scenes, it was either she's already dead or coma or similar.
The writing is very straightfoward and simple with a long common route followed by short routes, there isn't anything really special about this game which is what surprised me the most since at least as far as I know it was a big hit back then which spawned this really long series. I guess seeing the cover heroine actually not being a heroine and being a dead exgf was more revolutionary and hitted harder back then.
Anyways, the first route I did was the actual main girl Yue the other osananajimi which is basically the main route and probably what I'd recommend to read first too since it's the route that gets more into the game's theme of overcoming death of your partner and moving on with life. The rest of routes are more hit and miss, and it gets increasingly annoying to do since you have to skip through the entire game with infinite choices, you almost spend more time skipping than reading the routes. For the second route I went for Ayaka since I saw on VNDB she was also written by the main writer, and she was listed last in the kouryaku, I was slighly confused as to why was and how she would have a route, if it would be just flashbacks or Key magic or what. But her "route" is basically one scene where the protag gets 40ºc fever and has a dream where she cheers you up in a meta way for failing to get into a route aka not overcoming her death. For the rest of routes Minamo probably gets the better deal since her route seemed the longest and the most tragic drama filled one. Although my favorite in general was Karou (CV: Tamura Yukari) since her route is basically moege tier where they both just hang out and the main conflict is even resolved off screen in a simple way, but Yukarin kills it and nails the tfw no gf feeling like nobody else. The one route i did not do was Shion's since I just did not have in me to skip through the entire game one more time tbh.
The FD Pure was also included and actually included a route for Yue, Minamo and Ayaka, sadly it was just a prequel so it's not really an Ayaka route here neither, goes a bit more into detail how was it when she was alive but it's really short, the other two routes are basically the same but with a non canon ending, nothing really remarkable but it comes bundled with modern versions of the main game so may aswell take a peek if you want more of this for some reason.
In general very weak game, definetly a tier or two below Kanon at the time which is basically my only frame of reference here from 1999

From the first scene you can already tell the jump in writing quality, entering the 00s and focusing more on the scenario than the dating/攻略 aspects. I mean, it still has a shitton of choices but the characters are all more interesting and the summer inaka-ish (not really inaka but near the beach) more present giving it an extra flavor. The gist of this game is that the protagonist Inami Ken is already dating the main heroine Hotaru right of the bat, spending the summer vacation with her while she prepares for a big piano event he starts realizing he never really liked Hotaru and has doubts about his future now that he has much more free time to reflect on without anything to do now that he quitted his soccer club.
Whenever Hotaru is busy with Piano he goes around roaming and starts meeting other girls and so the game basically kind of becomes how to horribly break up with your girlfriend simulator since every route you end up falling in love with someone else and fucking up your relationship with Hotaru, which at some point even becomes hard to read since she's such an angel... Even in the very same Hotaru's route you end breaking up too, interestingly enough she has the worst and more simple route of all of them since it's really short with a very random ending. But yeah here you can pick who you want to cheat your gf with basically, her best friend, your cowoker, classmate, sensei, even her sister because why not. I'd probably recommend to take out Hotaru's route first to not get spoiled in the "twist" since it's the only thing her route has really going for it, and from there move off to other routes as you please. Every route has a different writer so the story between them differ quite a bit at times, surprisingly the quality and writing style is mostly about the same. Nothing groundbreaking but solid enough.
My far favourite is the best friend's route Tomoe though, it's the one route that puts as much focus in the break off as it does in a natural new relationship with Tomoe, and it also keeps Hotaru on screen instead of she ignoring you for most of it like the other route's do. Tomoe is a very achieved character and she has great chemistry with the protagonist, the one heroine I actually thought she was better than Hotaru, probably also the one route closer to WA2 in feeling so that does help too.
The game is also quite a bit longer than the first, it has much less skipping to do and the routes go from 1h long to like 2-3h generally so they have quite a bit more going for it.
The fandisk included in the remasters and in Duet here is 雪蛍 (YukiHotaru) great name of course, I couldn't find any info about this online so I was kinda curious, but as you can guess in a similar vein that the FD for the first game it' a prequel, well actually has 5 minutes of sequel and all the content is a flashback, but this time it focuses exclusively in Hotaru for the year prior to start dating Ken. This was way more interesting I thought at first since it's written in third person ADV which is extremely rare, and even takes the effort to voice Ken. It's about 4 hours long following Hotaru akwardly trying to attrack Ken's attention, but I thought it was pretty good and cute, even has a little drama near the end in the most memoff fashion. Solid read if you like Hotaru's character, if not probably skip since it doesn't really add anything important new.
