A new doujin VN released at C102, caught my attention looking up new releases since it looked fresh from a new circle with cool setting and nice art.
It's in some sort of dystopian future where WW3 has been going on for years. The protagonist Kai is some soldier for Lagoon, a city made from and for kids completly aside of adults in an amusement park, looked like some Peter Pan city.
In a mission he meets with Mio a girl soldier who's been abandoned and decides to help her out. He soon discovers that her brain memories works through a NM-card, a device similar to some sort of disk drive that stores her memories since she can't do it naturally. Soon enough they start living together in Lagoon developing a relationship.

It's mainly a slice of life game where nothing much happens, the setting isn't really explored much and the only tidbits of interesting plot happen right at the start and at the end; most of the time it's just hanging out in Lagoon. Now this would be fine except that the writing is weak as hell, there isn't any kind of thematic beats or weight to the writing, it's very basic and has not much going for it. It also doesn't help that doesn't explore the setting or much of Lagoon even.

The last part of the story both the protagonist and girl decide to take a long trip to a city at the north to fix her memory device before it breaks down, sadly this involves erasing her memories completly. Now this is where I actually expected this to pick this up but sadly it goes from 0 to 100 nakige mode and since the characters weren't interesting to begin with it's hard to care about any of it so doesn't do much. I'm not much of a fan of plots that revolve characters forgetting memories to start off, but this history doesn't even try to do anything with it sadly.

To say something positive i'd say both endings are interesting at least, the true ED is a bit random but at least I didn't predict it. the character designs look cool and the CGs are all pretty nice, the ost is really good too and it even has a vocal OP and ED songs that sound nice. But yeah the game is around 4-6 hours focused on 日常 stuff that's not very entertaining, would have prefer to see more of the setting and the other female character that looked way more interesting that Mio.
